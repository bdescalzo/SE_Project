# Txik/IA Intelligent Math Helper - Requirements Analysis

1. A user that enter the application need to login the application in order to use it. If they doesn't have an account to login yet, they should sign up. Each user has a username and password. Once the user has been logged in, they can log out and register again to the same account or to another one whenever they wants.

2. A registered user wants to work in its math projects, that are saved with several information in a projects database.

3. For each project, the user can ask questions related to this project to the LLM AI of our application, so a chat with it is open. The user can revise the previous questions they has asked the IA before.

4. Another option for each project is a generator of quizes, where the application makes a quiz with questions related to the project. Once the user has finished the quiz, it is evaluated and they recieve some feedback. This helps the user to practice.

5. The last option for the projects is a question generator, where some more evaluated questions related to the project he/she is working on are generated. The user should write an elaborated answer, with their answer and some explanations about it. The application should evaluate the response of the user and give some feedback to them, explaining what they did well in their response and what they did wrong (in this case, the application corrects it and explain the correct solution).

6. The user might want to access any of the project they has worked on whenever they wants, so all the information about the projects should be stored (this includes the questions previously asked to the IA chat, the quizs done by the user by the time and the problems user has previosly been asked by the application. The solutions and feedback given for these quizs and elaborated questions should also be stored).
